        <h1>Hopes for IS413:</h1>
        <p>
            Over the course of this class, I hope to learn marketable skills that I can include on my resume.<br />
            I want to get a better grasp of what working on large-scale projects in teams will be like in the industry.<br />
            I want to find out if development is one of my interests that I'd like to pursue for my actual career.<br />
            I also want to make meaningful connections with my classmates, have fun along the way, and get an A in the class :)
